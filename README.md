# Privacy preserving algorithms in the release of healthcare data

## Abstract

Privacy plays an essential role when it comes to managing healthcare information. People classify healthcare data as one of the most sensitive types of data and would not want it to be shared or leaked. On the other hand, healthcare data can be used in fields such as patient care, medical imaging, and research. With the data being so sensitive yet so useful, robust techniques must be put in place to preserve privacy and utilise the information for the benefit of the public.
My project focuses on the comparison of different privacy-preserving algorithms that could be used for a healthcare database or a query. Specifically, I focus on the differentially private algorithms and compare the results of a query on a dataset that has had a differentially private mechanism applied to it. The comparison involves various mechanisms such a Laplace and Gaussian and focuses on the Utility/Privacy trade-off. With the use of graphs, I can show the effect of a parameter epsilon used in differentially private mechanisms on the utility or privacy of a query or a dataset.
